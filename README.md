## MOTIVATION
This private repository is used to develope the back-end for the TrainingBudday APP.

## GETTING STARTED
[gt]: #getting-started 'Getting started guide'

The codes have been uploaded to Heroku, and can be accessed through the HTTP address:

In the following usage guide, the keyword **_url_** will be referred to this address.
Currently there are two models implemented in this back-end development: _users_ and _tb_events_. Both models support *CRUB* operations with **_Express_** and **_MongoDB_**.

Routes about users:
- POST /users
- GET /users/me
- DELETE /users/me/token
- POST /users/login

Routes about tb_events:
- POST /tb_events
- GET /tb_events
- GET /tb_events/:id
- GET /tb_events/users/:userId
- DELETE /tb_events/:id
- PATCH /tb_events/:id

Public routes can be invokded without tokens, while private ones require tokens to execute the operations. 
Therefore, users can check the tb_events created by other users, but they can only delete and update their own tb_events.
All tb_events will be created with users' token as one of the key value. 

Regarding the security of users' data, all passwords that users provided will be hashed before being stored in our database. In current stage, the authentication only allows new users to sign up with their **email/password**. There are some other tasks are on-going for TrainingBuddy APP.

- [ ] Integration of Facebook authentication.
- [ ] To upload pictures or videos of users/tb_events.
- [ ] Other features may be supported in the future.
